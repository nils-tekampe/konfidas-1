Over the last four years I participated in the BEAT Project â€“ a project funded under the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission. The project has been successfully finalized in March 2016 and its results are spreading into the relevant communities. As part of the project, I developed a guide for the Common Criteria evaluation of biometric technology, considering all the current aspects of Common Criteria and biometric technology.
