The Smart Meter Gateway Protection Profile (BSI-CC-PP-0073) is a Protection Profile with far-reaching implications for a whole industry. In cooperation with the Technical Guideline TR-03109 the Protection Profile contains the requirements on the communication component of intelligent metering systems.

The SMGW-PP is for sure one of the most interesting PP development projects that I have worked on so far. The development has been a challenge. On the one hand the Common Criteria have been a novum for many of the developers that were involved; on the other hand we received an unprecedented amount of comments on the drafts of the Protection Profile from the industrial associations that have been involved int the process. From the perspective of the development, discussion and the amount of comments, this document is for sure one of the most complex ones that I have worked on so far.

Eventually the development of the PP has been a success; the use of this Protection Profile has been made mandatory by the „Gesetz zur Digitalisierung der Energiewende“ The exact regulations about this can be found in §20 of MsbG. The complete version of the PP can be found here.
