2018 has been a great year. While 2017 has been our ramp up phase, 2018 has been a year of development and progress for konfidas. Also many things from 2017 stabilized over this year. A few highlights:

* The first customer who has been supported by us finished their certification according to Common Criteria,
* More customers are following closely.
* In the context of a new study, we supported ENISA to research the implementation of the Cyber Security Act in Europe. The results are not yet public but I guess it is fair to say that the Cyber Security Act will bring interesting impulses to the certification landscape of Europe.
The year has also been an economical success. Therefore, it has been the right time to pursue the business of konfidas UG in form of konfidas GmbH.

Also in 2018 we would like to give others the chance to participate in our success and are – by the support of the following organizations – also establishing one of the first real traditions of the company.
