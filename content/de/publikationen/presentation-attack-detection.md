Mechanisms for the detection of Presentation Attacks against biometric systems have come into the attention of the scientific community and developers over the last few years. In order to describe test results and to evaluate the performance of those Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) mechanisms various metrics have been developed and discussed. This paper summarizes the results of the work that has been performed in the context of the B.E.A.T. project.
