#### The study

In 2017, konfidas worked together with other international experts in the area of certification in IT-security to set up an overview study on ICT certification laboratories. Work on this study has been funded by ENISA. The final study has now been [published](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/overview-of-the-practices-of-ict-certification-laboratories-in-europe%20).

The study seeks to identify and analyse the current landscape of ICT security certification laboratories in
EU Member States, comparing them also with third countries practices. The findings of this study will
constitute the basis for the Agency’s proposal towards an EU wide ICT products and services certification
framework.
